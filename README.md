kamayoq is an open-source control plane for agentic operations. It runs AI agents
under policy, sends each tool call through one gateway, and keeps an audit record
of each action.

## Status

Pre-alpha. Under design. Not ready for use. See the roadmap in [#10](https://github.com/jtdub/kamayoq/issues/10).

## Components

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| kamayoq | The control plane defines agents, runs them, and applies policy and approvals. |
| tambo | The MCP gateway checks scopes, injects secrets, and applies rate limits for each agent tool call. |
| quipu | The audit store writes a hash-chained, append-only record of prompts, tool calls, decisions, and results. |

## What kamayoq is not

- Not an agent framework. kamayoq runs agents on adapters, with LangGraph as the default.
- Not a model provider or an LLM proxy. It calls providers through the LiteLLM SDK, with no proxy.
- Not a multi-tenant SaaS. It is single-tenant and self-hosted.
- Not an install guide. Install steps come with the deployment work.
